          <p>Welcome! The beautiful life is a daily lifestyle site for women. We cover everything from fashion to culture to job opportunities, and we strive to be authentic. As Olive Kitteridge said, "There's no such thing as a simple life." Thank you for reading.</p>
        <p>We started somewhere in 2010 as an interesting means of noting, chronicling and expressing ideas, projects, inspirations and daydreams. It has constantly evolved ever since and become more fashion & lifestyle oriented.

           Our posts vary from fashion to beauty to trends to food and then some more. Theres trendspotting at Fashion Weeks, reviews of collections, outfit posts, unique products, jewelry and accessories and whatever else that seems to catch our fancy at the time!
