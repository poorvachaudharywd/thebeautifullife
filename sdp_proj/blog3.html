    <p>This is our take on some of the best food cultures and destinations.
        It's time to find out once and for all, which cuisine is king as you plan where you'll travel next.</p>
    <p>1.In the kitchens of the United States, pizza has  been improved and added to, to become global icons for food lovers everywhere. Don't neglect the homegrown American dishes either. There's the traditional stuff such as clam chowder, key lime pie and Cobb salad and of course cheeseburgers.<br>

        2.Street eats are a Thai attraction.Thais fit spicy, sour, salty, sweet, chewy, crunchy and slippery into one dish.The best part about eating Thai food in Thailand though is the hospitality. Sun, beach, service with a smile and a plastic bag full of som tam -- that's the good life.</p>
        <p>3. Japan is a place that spawned tyrannical sushi masters and ramen bullies who make their staff and customers tremble with a glare.
            You can get a lavish multicourse kaiseki meal that presents the seasons in a spread of visual and culinary poetry. Or grab a seat at a revolving sushi conveyor for a solo feast. 
        <br>
            4. Indian cuisine uses spices in such abundance that the meat and vegetables seem like an afterthought, you know you're dealing with cooks dedicated to flavor. There are no rules for spice usage as long as it results in something delicious.</p>
        <p>5. the Chinese don't just cook and sell anything, they also make it taste great.China's regional cuisines are so varied it's hard to believe they're from the same nation.
            <br>
            6. Italian food has enslaved tastebuds around the globe for centuries, with its zesty tomato sauces, those clever things they do with wheat flour and desserts that are basically vehicles for cream. It's all so simple.</p><br>
        <p>You can be ensured to never go hungry if you are open and willing to try new taste experiences. It is impossible to objectively decide which cuisine is most delicious, but if you consider your taste buds, they know what will make you mouth water.</p>
