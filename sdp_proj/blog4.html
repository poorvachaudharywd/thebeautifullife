    <p>Despite what you see on Instagram, being a travel agent isn’t always glamorous. As amazing as it is to jet around the world, you also have to keep in contact with clients 24/7/365—no matter what timezone you’re in. And while technically anyone can work in this field, only those who are detail-oriented and meticulously organized will excel. So we talked to former travel agent Katelyn O'Shaughnessy and current agent Erina Pindar to find out what their jobs are actually like.</p>
    <p>"Think about this as a lifestyle rather than a career," says O'Shaughnessy. The pay isn't necessarily exorbitant —the median income is $38,700 a year, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, but according to Pindar, it can actually be much higher. "Agents make anywhere from $50-100K on the low end and up to $250-500K annually," says Pindar. But there's no other industry where you get to travel like this. You'll regularly go on discounted trips to luxury resorts sponsored by hotel companies, so based on your Instagram alone, your friends will definitely think you're living the high life.</p>
        <p>The bulk of your salary will come from commission, so first and foremost, you're a salesperson. When you're an in-house agent with a travel agency (on-staff positions at agencies are increasingly rare, btw, but they're still in demand), you typically have a base salary and a commission split. This can vary from agency to agency, and also depends on your level of experience. For example, let's say you have an 80–20 commission split. That means if you get paid 10 percent commission on booking a hotel, 80 percent of that commission goes to your agency while you keep 20 percent. If you've rounded up enough clients, you can become an independent agent, which means you work for yourself but remain affiliated with a host agency. As an independent agent, you lose the base salary but get to keep your commission.</p>
        <p>Let's say you make a mistake on your clients' itinerary, causing them to miss their first-class flight, which costs $6,000 a seat. If you did something wrong, you're liable. "There are hundreds of things that can go wrong, and they will," warns O'Shaughnessy. You definitely need errors and omissions insurance, which can be expensive, but if you accidentally screw something up, you don't have to pay out of pocket for the cost of the mistake.</p>
        <p>While in the past, travel agents mainly assisted in booking accommodations, a travel advisor helps provide a client with a broader picture of their trip. "If someone says, 'I want to go to Cabo and I want to do all of these adventurous things,' We may say, 'Okay, great, you can go to Cabo, but you may not want to stay on the strip. You may want to consider the new Four Seasons that just opened on the cape because there's a lot more adventure on that side of the destination,'" explains Pindar.</p>
        <p>Unlike being a real estate agent, where you have to pass a series of tests to prove you know your stuff. "When I started working as a travel agent right out of college, I didn't know anything," insists O'Shaughnessy. "I'd barely even traveled out of Portland, where I grew up. I got the job after a series of persistent emails and a good first interview. It's definitely useful to know things like basic history and geography but there are no real required skills."

            Travel agents tend to come from a variety of backgrounds—you can switch careers at any point in your life and become a travel agent with a pretty low barrier to entry. But according to Pindar, it does takes a specific personality to be a quality agent. "One thing that all of our agents have in common is they're great salespeople, because at the end of the day, this is a sales job," she says.</p>    
        <br>
        <p>"Every time I tell someone I'm a travel agent, they're like, 'Wait, travel agents still exist?' The answer: Yes, and we still account for one-third of all travel booked in the United States," insists O'Shaughnessy. It's still a profitable industry in the United States and there's no reason to believe the industry is dying off.</p>
